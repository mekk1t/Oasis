"Oasis" Web Application.

This is a web app designed for my diploma. I intended it to work with a made-up cinema net called "Oasis Cinema".
At the moment of July, 12th this app allows to view all the cinemas, films, its sessions and tickets and to add them to Cart, checkout operation and remove items from cart.
Also there's a personal cabinet although it's not designed properly yet.

I made it work in a few days. Works locally for the time being.
